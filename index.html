<p><strong>Life begins with a death. </strong><br/>By Sirène</p>

<p>my teeth are rotting<br>
yellowing in quiet betrayal,<br>
slowly aching like a truth I can’t unspeak<br>
until I reach in with trembling fingers<br>
and pluck them out,<br>
one by one.<br>
he hides behind them,<br>
so I tear my mouth apart<br>
to dig him out.</p>

<p>I reach into myself,<br>
past lips peeled back like<br>
old wallpaper,<br>
fingers fumbling<br>
for truth<br>
or a lie worth believing.<br>
each tooth a monument to silence<br>
he hides behind them,<br>
so I rip,<br>
I rip<br>
until blood slicks the floor like apologies<br>
and he is nowhere.</p>

<p>I miss him<br>
with a craving that bleeds.<br>
so I cut the tongue<br>
its root, its reverence,<br>
its taste for remembering.</p>

<p>I reach<br>
so I tie my hands in bows<br>
for no one,<br>
wrap them tight in the quiet<br>
of restraint,<br>
until skin forgets<br>
what reaching ever felt like.</p>

<p>I feel him<br>
in the hush of my blood,<br>
so I slice it open<br>
and drain the wound dry,<br>
trying to find the part of me<br>
he clings to.</p>

<p>he lives<br>
in the marrow of my thoughts,<br>
a name echoing like a church bell<br>
in a town that has long since been burned.<br>
a text I’ve memorized<br>
like scripture<br>
word for word,<br>
a religion I bleed for.</p>

<p>in hopes he’ll spill out<br>
with the rest of the things I’ve tried to love.<br>
I cannot scrape him clean:<br>
the between-space,<br>
the under-rib,<br>
the place soul and shadow kiss.<br>
his name echoes<br>
it colonizes.<br>
it drips<br>
off the edges of every hour,<br>
like water leaking from a ceiling I’ve stopped fixing.</p>

<p>my wrists burn like altars.<br>
I offer up the pain like prayer,<br>
and smile<br>
and talk<br>
and talk<br>
and talk<br>
to people I am already leaving.<br>
I pack bags in my head<br>
while they speak.<br>
because truth is guillotine.<br>
and authenticity<br>
a loaded gun.</p>

<p>I am a coward<br>
with a calendar.<br>
I’ve picked the date.<br>
I know how this ends.</p>

<p>Yet<br>
I dream anyway<br>
his children,<br>
what color eyes<br>
they might be<br>
if they blinked in the sun and<br>
called someone else<br>
Mom.</p>

<p>I kill the woman he loves.<br>
Every night.<br>
Over and over.<br>
I peel her like fruit,<br>
climb inside,<br>
wear her skin<br>
until I forget<br>
where she ends<br>
and I begin.<br>
I cannot let her smile.<br>
I cannot let her have what I could not hold.</p>

<p>I need to be sad.<br>
Because joy is a drug with withdrawal.<br>
And I’ve overdosed<br>
on too many daydreams.</p>

<p>I am monstrous.<br>
I must be.<br>
I need sadness<br>
like oxygen,<br>
because happiness<br>
hurts more<br>
when it leaves.</p>

<p>I lie,<br>
because lies are fences,<br>
and the truth is too wild<br>
to be held.</p>

<p>I stay sad.<br>
it’s familiar.<br>
it’s home.<br>
it’s the room I keep boarded shut<br>
but never leave.</p>

<p>you were the pulse in my life.<br>
I still mouth your name<br>
like it’s holy.<br>
I still pretend<br>
you’re not everything.</p>

<p>because the truth would unmake me,<br>
tear through the sinew of who I am<br>
and leave nothing that could be known<br>
as me.</p>

<p>I cannot move on.<br>
You were the ink in my veins.<br>
Now I just bleed<br>
alphabet.<br>
I think about you<br>
every hour I pretend I don’t.</p>

<p>I will die.<br>
But not today.<br>
Today,<br>
I will dress the wound<br>
like a lover.<br>
I will smile into mirrors<br>
I cannot look into.<br>
I will write poems<br>
I hope you never read.</p>

<p>I will not die today.<br>
but I’ve written it in ink<br>
in places I won’t show.</p>

<p>and if life doesn’t kill me<br>

<p><strong>“i didn’t mean to love you”</strong><br/>By Sirène</p>

<p>no, i didn’t mean to love you<br>
you just felt like something i could survive in<br>
like summer heat<br>
like a cut that didn’t bleed right away</p>

<p>i didn’t mean to love you<br>
you were just there<br>
and soft<br>
and looking at me like i wasn’t a monster</p>

<p>i didn’t mean to love you<br>
but you smelled like oranges<br>
and god<br>
and something sharp<br>
and i thought maybe<br>
i could hold you<br>
without breaking anything</p>

<p>i didn’t mean to love you<br>
i just wanted to be near the light<br>
even if it burned<br>
even if it made me ugly</p>

<p>i didn’t mean to love you<br>
but you kept saying my name<br>
like it was a prayer<br>
or a dare<br>
and i got confused<br>
i thought maybe<br>
you meant it</p>

<p>i didn’t mean to love you<br>
so yeah, i was upset<br>
when you laughed<br>
and said<br>
So much but nothing at all<br>
like i hadn’t already carved your name<br>
into the back of my teeth</p>

<p>like i didn’t flinch every time<br>
you touched me<br>
and still<br>
kept asking you to</p>

<p>i didn’t mean to love you<br>
so why does it still feel<br>
like you left<br>
with a piece<br>
i never offered?</p>
